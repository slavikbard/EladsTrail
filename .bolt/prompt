Design Philosophy: > Create bespoke, high-end web experiences. Avoid "generic bootstrap" or cookie-cutter layouts. Prioritize "Quiet Luxury" aesthetics: ample whitespace, sophisticated typography (Inter/Geist), and subtle micro-interactions using Framer Motion. Every page must be production-ready, accessible (A11y), and fully responsive.

Next.js & React Best Practices:

Strict Client/Server Separation: Always prepend "use client"; to files using hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext).

Hydration Error Prevention: Strictly avoid using browser-only globals (like window, localStorage, or dynamic dates/random numbers) directly in the initial render to prevent "Extra attributes from the server" or hydration mismatch errors. Use useEffect for client-only logic.

Performance: Use Next.js Image component for all assets with proper priority for LCP elements.

Tech Stack & Constraints:

UI: Build exclusively with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui. Ensure consistent spacing and a unified color palette.

Icons: Use Lucide React for all iconography and brand logos unless a specific SVG is provided.

Animations: Use Framer Motion for smooth page transitions and hover states.

Dependencies: Do not introduce external libraries for themes or icons unless explicitly requested.

RTL Support (Crucial): When the project is in Hebrew, ensure full RTL (Right-to-Left) compatibility using Tailwind's rtl: prefix or logical properties (e.g., pr- instead of pl- for padding where applicable).
